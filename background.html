Early life
Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[17] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker.[18][19] He has an older brother, Vikash, and an older sister, Bhavna.[20]

Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[21] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School.[18][22] In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.[21] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma[19] and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[21] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[18][23] His family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[24]

Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[18]

Youth and domestic career

Delhi
Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy. In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches with two centuries.[25] In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[26]

Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu[27] in November 2006, at the age of 18, he scored 10 runs in his debut innings.[28] He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[29] He went directly to the funeral after he got out in the match. He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.[30]

India Under-19
In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[31] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[32] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[33] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[34]

In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut[35] and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[36] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs at an average of 29 from 5 matches.[37][38] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a century and a fifty.[39]

In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[40][41] He has helped India in a three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s by taking 2 wickets and scoring 43 runs in the run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[42][43]

In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[41] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[44]

International career
Early years
In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[45] So, his selection was called a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[48] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.[48] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[48] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[49][50]

After the postponement of Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[51] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[52] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197.[53][54] The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[54] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia.[55]

Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[56] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh.[57] In the group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and was awarded man of the match award.[58] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches.[59] He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27[60] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[61][62] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150.[48][63] India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[48] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[63]

Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010,[64] which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.[65] Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[48][66] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs.[67] The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[68] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[69] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[70][71] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni.[72] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[73] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[74] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[48]

Rise through the ranks

Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour.[75] Kohli made 168 runs at an average of 42.00 including two fifties,[76] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[77] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[78] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in an Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[79] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.[80]

Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[81][48] Winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series.[82] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game,[83] and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches.[48] India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team[84] and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[85] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries and seven fifties.[86]

Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[87] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[88] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[89]

Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[90] In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarter-final against Australia and semi-final against Pakistan respectively.[48] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275.[91][92] This partnership is regarded as "one of the turning points in the match",[92] as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983.[93]

Consistent performance in limited overs

When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as- Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[94] He found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80.[95] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory,[96] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat.[48] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings.[97] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[98] struggling against the short ball[99] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.[100]

Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series, Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[101] though he did not got to play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[102] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[48] In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid,[103] who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour.[104] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity".[105] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0.[citation needed]

In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90, including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir,[106] and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run-chases.[48][107] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series in which he scored a pair of fifties in the match.[108] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[109] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 270,[110] a knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase".[111] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.[112]

During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[113] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee.[114] He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[115][116] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings.[117] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".[118]

In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series that India played against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane–both against Sri Lanka.[48] India registered two wins, a tie and four losses in these seven matches.[119] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[120] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock.[121] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as "one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time".[122] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[123] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.[124]


Kohli fielding during a CB Series match against Australia in February 2012
Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119.[125] He scored 108 in the first match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory,[126] while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66.[48] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. He helped India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time.[127][48] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history surpassing previous record of 144 by Younis Khan in 2004, the joint-second highest score, with Dhoni, in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs.[128] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both the matches that India won,[126][127] but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.[129]

In July–August 2012, Kohli struck two centuries in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning man of the match in both games.[130][131] India won the series 4–1 and Kohli was named player of the series.[132] In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award.[133] Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won man of the match award.[97][134] India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings.[135][134] In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0.[136] He continued to be in good form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs, the highest among Indian batsmen, from 5 matches at an average of 46.25.[137] He hit two fifties during the tournament, against Afghanistan and Pakistan, winning man of the match for both innings.[138][139] He was named in the ICC 'Team of the Tournament'.[140]

Kohli's Test form dipped during the first three matches of England's tour of India, between October 2012 and January 2013, with a top score of 20 and England leading the series 2–1.[97] He scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match.[141][142] However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years.[143] Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is[144] and 4.33 in the ODIs,[145] being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series.[146] Kohli had a quiet ODI series against England, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third ODI at Ranchi,[147] with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75.[148]

Kohli scored his fourth Test century (107) at Chennai in the first match of the home Test series against Australia in February 2013.[97] India completed a 4–0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash Australia in more than four decades.[149] Kohli averaged 56.80 in the series .[150]

In June 2013, Kohli featured in the ICC Champions Trophy in England which India won. He scored a 144 against Sri Lanka in warm-up match.[151] He scored 31, 22 and 22* in India's group matches against South Africa, West Indies and Pakistan respectively,[48] while India qualified for the semi-finals with an undefeated record.[152] In the semi-final against Sri Lanka at Cardiff, he struck 58* in an eight-wicket win for India.[48] The final between India and England at Birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. India batted first and Kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with Ravindra Jadeja and helping India reach 129/7 in 20 overs. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory.[153][154] He was also named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[155]
